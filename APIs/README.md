### API

* **API Application Programming Interface**  
    * Set of definitions, rules and protocols for building and integrating application software.
    * eg: two programms need to communicate because they provide different pieces of functionality
        * We plance an **interface** between them (API) that bridges the communication between different pieces of software
        * OpenWeather collects data, we pick that data and render dynamic content based on that information
    * There are different types of APIs
        * GraphQL, SOAP, Rest:API ...
        * These are arquitectural sytles
    * **REST APIs**
        * The most common used API on web development
        * It uses the **HTTP protocol** to interact with the API (get, post, put, patch, delete)

### Formatting API Request

* **Private API**
    * Our **frontend** makes a requests to our **server**, server gives a response
* **Public API**
    * Our **server** request to other **server**, that server gives back a response
    * This module is about how to use Public APIs
<br />

* API Endpoints
    * <i>BaseURL/<b>endpoint</b></i>
    * The endpoint is basically a different route on the API provider server 
    * The documentation tents to give an example of endpoints and its purpose
* Query Parameters
    * <i>BaseURL/endpoint<b>?query=value</b></i>
