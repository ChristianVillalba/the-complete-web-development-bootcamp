## Notes

### Introduction to Authentication
* Authentication:
    * In order to associate pieces of data with individual users, we need to create an Account for each user
        * User sign up to our website using a username and a password
        * We uniquely identify the users on our database, and
        * Save all of the data that they generate onto that account
        * Be able to access all of those possibly private pieces of information
    * Other reason: restrict access
* The difficult part of authentication: how secure you're going to make your website

### Registering Users with Email and Password
* Project: AuthenticationLvl1
* We can allow users to register and log in to our website by using an Email and Password.
* This is the most basic way of authenticating an user, and the least secure.

### Encryption and Hashing
