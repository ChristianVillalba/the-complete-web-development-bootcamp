## Notes

### BOOTSTRAP

* **Bootstrap** is a **CSS framework**.     
* It contains **pre-made CSS files**, which we can simply include into our project in order to use their pre-built components and styling.       
* **Mobile First approach**
    * 12 column layout system built on top of Flexbox.
    * Creates responsive websites 
    * Creates Websites that work and look great on mobile as well as desktop   

### How to use Bootstrap:
* CDN Link
    * Hold the stylesheet from an external source
* Download the source code itself
    * Link it to our project
     
HTML is executed from top to bottom:
    1. Bootstrap link
    2. CSS stylesheet
Otherwise, Bootstrap will override our styles.

### Bootstrap Layout
* The 12 column layout system: 
    * One of the most powerful features of Bootstrap
    * It is made of 3 components: 
        1. A **div** that has a **class** of **container**
        2. A **nested** container div of **class row**
        3. A **nested** container div of **class col**     
        ```html
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm">
                Hello World
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        ```
    * Multiple columns laid out inside these rows:
    * Bootstrap will automatically give every column inside the row 
        * Equal spacing and space them across the entire width of the container
