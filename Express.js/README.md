## Notes

###  EXPRESS JS WITH NODE JS
* Express.js is a back end **web application framework** for building web applications and APIs with Node.js.
* As a Node framework, it offers:
    * Better readability
    * Less code
    * Ability to add middleware

### Express Server
* The back-end consist on:
    * **A server** is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". It receives requests.
    * **An application** running on the server that listens for requests, retrieves information from the database, and sends a response.
    * **A database** used to organize and persist data.
<br /> 

* The back-end is also called Server Side
    * I created an application in JavaScript using Express and Node.
    * Express is the one that's going to use Node 
    * Our computer will work as a server
<br /> 

* Creating a Express Server:
    1. Create a directory
    2. Create index.js file
    3. Initialise NPM
        * `npm init -y` 
        *  Initialise without having it ask any questions:
    4. Install Express Package
        * `npm install express`
        * [Installing - Expressjs Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
        * *Notes:* edditing package.json   
            * To use Express, this file should have `express` in `dependencies`
            * `"main"` must be set to `"index.js"` and we need a file called **index.js**
            * In order to use ES6 syntax:      
                * We have to change our package.json to have the type set as module:
                * `"type": "module"`
    5. Write server app in index.js
    6. Start Server
        * In Terminal: `node index.js`
        * In Browser: `http://localhost:3000/`
<br /> 

* **Localhost**
    * We don't have a server on the Internet so we host our server locally.
