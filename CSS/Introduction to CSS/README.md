Styling can affect color, font, size, borders, and many properties.   

## Notes

### How to add CSS

There is 3 ways to add CSS to our website:
* Inline
    * Add Style to Html Element where it's placed
    * `<tag style="css-property: css-value"/>`
    * Good for targeting an individual Html Element
* Internal 
    * In <head>, add style to the specified element(s)
    * `<style> htmlElement {css-property: css-value;} </syle>`
    * Good for targeting an individual Html File
* External 
    * Styles in a separated file linked (in head) using:
    * `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.csss"`
    * It can target an entire website and it's multiple webpages
    * The good practice and most used system to style a website
    
We can style inside a HTML File but the good practice is link a .css file to our .html file
