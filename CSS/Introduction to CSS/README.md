# INTRODUCTION TO CSS

CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML file       
CSS describes how the HTML elements will be displayed

Styling can affect color, font, size, borders, and many properties.   

There is 3 ways to add CSS to our website:
* Inline 
    * `<tag style="css"/>`
* Internal 
    * `<style>css</syle>`
* External 
    * `<link href="style.css"/>`

We can style inside a HTML File but the good practice is link a .css file to our .html file

### Hot to link HTML & CSS
(in html)(just before `</head>`)
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.csss">`
