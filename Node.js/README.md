## Notes

### Node

* Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime.
    * **Asynchronous**: JavaScript code doesn't have to do everything in sequential order.
    * **Event-Driven**: the order can be dictated by events in order to free up resources.
    * Node provides us with a **JavaScript runtime** so that we can run JavaScript on a machine.
        * such as your own local computer.
* NodeJS is designed to build scalable network applications,
* Node.js allows us to create a backend using Javascript     
    * It is fast and will allow us to create really scalable and fast running web sites.
    * Node.js allows us to take Javascript out of the browser and it liberates it...      
        * allowing it to interact directly with the hardware of a computer.
